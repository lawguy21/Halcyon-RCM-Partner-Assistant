    <div class="section-header">History of Present Illness</div>
    <p>Ms. Thompson is a 50-year-old female with a significant past medical history of COPD (GOLD Stage III), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, CKD stage 3, and major depressive disorder who presented to the emergency department on 12/28/2025 with a 4-day history of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough with yellowish-green sputum, and low-grade fever.</p>
    <p>The patient reports that she ran out of her COPD maintenance inhalers approximately 2 weeks ago and was unable to afford refills after losing her job in November 2025. She has been using her albuterol rescue inhaler with increasing frequency, up to 8-10 times daily. She also reports continued cigarette smoking, approximately 1 pack per day for the past 30 years (30 pack-year history).</p>
    <p>On presentation, she was in moderate respiratory distress with oxygen saturation of 84% on room air. She was immediately placed on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4L/min with improvement to 92%.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-header">Hospital Course</div>
    <p>The patient was admitted to the medical floor with telemetry monitoring. Initial workup revealed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chest X-ray: Right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia, hyperinflated lungs</li>
      <li>ABG on admission: pH 7.32, pCO2 52, pO2 58, HCO3 26 (compensated respiratory acidosis)</li>
      <li>WBC: 14,200 with left shift</li>
      <li>Procalcitonin: 1.8 ng/mL</li>
      <li>BNP: 450 pg/mL</li>
      <li>Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL (baseline 1.4)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>She was started on IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia, systemic corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 125mg IV daily), scheduled nebulizer treatments, and continued on supplemental oxygen.</p>
    <p>By hospital day 3, the patient showed clinical improvement with decreasing oxygen requirements. She was transitioned to oral prednisone taper and oral antibiotics. Pulmonology was consulted and recommended continuation of long-acting bronchodilator therapy and consideration for pulmonary rehabilitation.</p>
    <p>Social work was consulted given the patient's reported financial difficulties and lack of insurance. She was screened for Medicaid eligibility and connected with hospital financial assistance programs. Psychiatry was also consulted given her history of depression; her current antidepressant regimen was continued.</p>
    <p>By hospital day 6, the patient was ambulating independently, tolerating oral intake, and maintaining oxygen saturation >92% on room air. She was deemed stable for discharge.</p>
